Shared Dependencies:

1. "Board" struct: This is shared across all the files as it represents the chess board. It is defined in "src/chess/board.rs" and used in all other files.

2. "Piece" trait: This trait is defined in "src/chess/pieces/mod.rs" and implemented in all the individual piece files ("src/chess/pieces/king.rs", "src/chess/pieces/rook.rs", "src/chess/pieces/pawn.rs", "src/chess/pieces/knight.rs", "src/chess/pieces/bishop.rs", "src/chess/pieces/queen.rs"). It provides a common interface for all chess pieces.

3. "Game" struct: This struct is defined in "src/chess/game.rs" and used in the test files to simulate a game for testing purposes.

4. "Position" struct: This struct is defined in "src/chess/utils.rs" and used across all the files to represent the position of a piece on the board.

5. "is_valid_move" function: This function is defined in the "Piece" trait and implemented in all the individual piece files. It checks if a move is valid for a specific piece.

6. "move_piece" function: This function is defined in "src/chess/board.rs" and used in "src/chess/game.rs" and the test files to move a piece on the board.

7. "can_castle" function: This function is defined in "src/chess/pieces/king.rs" and "src/chess/pieces/rook.rs" and used in "src/chess/game.rs" and the test files to check if castling is possible.

8. "castling_tests", "pieces_tests", "board_tests", "game_tests": These are the names of the test modules defined in the respective test files. They contain unit tests for the corresponding components of the chess game.

9. "test_move", "test_castle", "test_check", "test_checkmate": These are the names of some of the individual tests defined in the test files. They test specific functionalities of the chess game.
