Shared dependencies across the files:

1. "Piece" Struct: This is a shared data schema across all the piece files (pawn.rs, knight.rs, bishop.rs, rook.rs, queen.rs, king.rs). It likely contains properties such as the piece's type, color, and current position.

2. "Board" Struct: This is a shared data schema across main.rs, board.rs, and tests.rs. It represents the chess board and likely contains properties such as the current state of the board and the positions of all pieces.

3. "PIECES" Constant: This seems to be a shared constant across multiple files. It likely represents all the pieces in a chess game.

4. "init" Function: This function is mentioned in the context of the Board and seems to be a shared function across board.rs and tests.rs. It likely initializes the board to its starting state.

5. "new" Function: This function is mentioned in the context of the Board and seems to be a shared function across board.rs and tests.rs. It likely creates a new instance of the Board.

6. "move" Function: This function is likely shared across all the piece files and possibly main.rs, board.rs, and tests.rs. It likely moves a piece from one position to another.

7. "capture" Function: This function is likely shared across all the piece files and possibly main.rs, board.rs, and tests.rs. It likely captures an opponent's piece.

8. "promote" Function: This function is likely shared in pawn.rs, main.rs, board.rs, and tests.rs. It likely promotes a pawn to another piece when it reaches the opposite end of the board.

9. "castling" Function: This function is likely shared in rook.rs, king.rs, main.rs, board.rs, and tests.rs. It likely implements the special move of castling.

10. "test" Functions: These functions are likely shared across tests.rs and possibly all other files. They likely test the functionality of the other functions and the behavior of the pieces.
