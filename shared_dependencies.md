Shared Dependencies:

1. "Piece" Struct: This is a shared data schema that is used across all the piece files (pawn.rs, knight.rs, bishop.rs, rook.rs, queen.rs, king.rs). It likely contains properties such as the piece's type, color, and current position.

2. "Board" Struct: This is another shared data schema that is used across multiple files. It represents the chess board and likely contains properties such as the current state of the board and methods for manipulating the board.

3. "PIECES" Constant: This is a shared exported variable that is imported in multiple files. It likely represents a list of all the pieces in the game.

4. "init_board" Function: This is a shared function that is used to initialize the board. It is likely used in the board.rs file and possibly in main.rs.

5. "castling" Function: This is a shared function that is used to implement the castling rule. It is likely used in the king.rs and rook.rs files, and possibly in the castling.rs file.

6. Test Functions: Each of the test files (chess_tests.rs, piece_tests.rs, pawn_tests.rs, knight_tests.rs, bishop_tests.rs, rook_tests.rs, queen_tests.rs, king_tests.rs, board_tests.rs, castling_tests.rs) will likely contain a series of test functions that are named after the functionality they are testing. These functions are shared in the sense that they follow a similar naming convention and structure, but they are not necessarily used across multiple files.

7. "move" Function: This is a shared function that is likely used in each of the piece files to implement the movement rules for each piece.

8. "capture" Function: This is another shared function that is likely used in each of the piece files to implement the capture rules for each piece.
