1. "Piece" Trait: This trait is shared across all the piece files (pawn.rs, knight.rs, bishop.rs, rook.rs, queen.rs, king.rs). It defines the common behavior of all chess pieces.

2. "Board" Struct: This struct is used in board.rs and main.rs. It represents the chess board and its current state.

3. "PIECES" Constant: This constant is used in multiple files to represent the different types of chess pieces.

4. "display", "get_move", "make_move", "checkmate", "stalemate" Functions: These functions are mentioned in main.rs but are not implemented. They are expected to be part of the Board struct in board.rs.

5. "init" Function: This function is mentioned in the tests and is expected to be part of the Board struct in board.rs.

6. "board::new" Function: This function is expected to be part of the Board struct in board.rs and is used to create a new instance of the board.

7. ".gitignore", "README.md", "Cargo.toml" Files: These files are shared across the project and are essential for the project's version control, documentation, and configuration respectively.

8. "tests" Module: This module is expected to contain all the tests for the application, including board_tests.rs and pieces_tests.rs.

9. "pieces" Module: This module is expected to contain all the piece files (pawn.rs, knight.rs, bishop.rs, rook.rs, queen.rs, king.rs, piece.rs, mod.rs). It is used to structure the code related to the chess pieces.
